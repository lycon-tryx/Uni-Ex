# Uni-eX
### Unity | Universe | Exploration


Uni-eX started as an Astrophysics Group on the Slack Platform in 2017, where some of the interested people would have discussions on the topics. The Slack Workspace grew to a decent member size, and continues to grow.

We aim to reach more people, and so, starting January 2019, the Uni-eX official website is launched

Uni-ex is a place where we carry out discussion about physics problems and we are on a journey of delving into the secrets of the cosmos .in this journey we will unravel the inner workings of the universe.

> Uni-ex can be considered as a home for all physics and science enthusiasts.
